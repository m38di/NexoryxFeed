        "prompt": "is a stylized logo or artwork, likely for a band or a design project.\u00a0 It features a large, central design element composed of interlocking, chrome-like, or metallic letters that appear to be stylized, possibly representing a name or title. The letters are sharp, angular, and have a three-dimensional, almost sculpted quality with highlights and shadows suggesting a metallic sheen.\u00a0\n\n\nThe overall style is dark and edgy, with a gothic or black metal aesthetic. The background is dark, almost black, with hints of bluish-gray textures and what look like faint, crackled lines or energy effects. These textures contrast with the bright, reflective quality of the central lettering.\n\nAt the bottom, a small, discreet text appears: \"AS GRAPHIC\" indicating the artist's name or the source of the artwork. The background details seem to be abstract and don't have a clear narrative or representational elements, their purpose being primarily to accentuate the dramatic effect of the central metallic lettering.\u00a0 The combination of darkness, sharp angles, and metallic reflections creates a striking and memorable visual piece.\n\n\n\u25cf \u0645\u062f\u0644: Gemini-Vision",
